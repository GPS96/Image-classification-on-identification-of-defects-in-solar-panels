# Image-classification-on-identification-of-defects-in-solar-panels

This is a PyTorch implementation of multi-label classification problem on identification of defects in solar panels.
Architecture used- ResNet

Files for executing the model:
1. data.py : Conduct ETL on the raw dataset
2. model.py : Define ResNet architecture
3. Trainer.py: Defines the training procedure for the model
4. train.py: Sets the pipeline that combines the above components.
